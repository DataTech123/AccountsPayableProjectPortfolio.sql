This project uses Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to self-design a relational database (DML & DDL theory) that focuses on tracking accounts payable's one-month summary of vendor payment statuses, including paid and unpaid. The solution of this project aims to support accounting and finance operations in usual challenges related to vendor account management.

In a particular case, an ERP accounting system connects all departments with a large dataset in databases, which have restrictions to access every function in each department's system. This project could be useful for retrieving data sources from the working databases, as it is often requested by stakeholders,including manager or director to ask for the payment status of a specific vendor account.

Design Database Explanation: When working with an ERP accounting system, it is unnessary to design a new database; it just needs to connect the ERP accounting system to SQL software (such as Oracle database or IBM database), depending on each company's system configuration.
 
Thank you so much for review and question.
